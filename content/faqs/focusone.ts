    question: "What is FocusONE?",
    answer:

There are no fixed batch dates—you schedule sessions when you need them for DGCA exam preparation.

Each session is live and interactive, so you can ask questions, work through problems, and get feedback in real time.",

    question: "Is FocusONE better than batch classes?",
    answer:
      "It depends on your schedule and learning style. FocusONE is better if you need flexible time slots, one-on-one attention, or want to focus on specific subjects. Batch classes work well if you prefer a fixed routine and peer interaction. Many students use both—FocusONE for weak subjects and batches for structure. If you are balancing work, flying, or other commitments, FocusONE lets you fit DGCA prep into your calendar without missing deadlines. You can also ramp up sessions close to exam dates or slow down when other priorities take over.",

  {
    question: "Can I book single subject sessions?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can book FocusONE sessions for a single subject—Air Regulation, Aviation Meteorology, Air Navigation, or Technical General—or combine multiple subjects. This is ideal for repeat attempt candidates or anyone strengthening one area. SkyPrep Aero's instructors tailor each session to your level and exam goals, so you can target weak topics, revise before a specific paper, or build confidence in a subject over several sessions. You decide the mix and frequency based on your preparation plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are recordings available?",
    answer:
      "No. Recorded session access is not available for FocusONE. We believe in the power of live learning and direct interaction with your instructor—asking follow-up questions, working through doubts on the spot, and getting real-time feedback. This keeps sessions focused and effective. If you miss a session, you can reschedule; we recommend attending live so you get the full benefit of personalised coaching and can clarify concepts immediately.",
  },
  {
    question: "How flexible are FocusONE schedules?",
    answer:
      "Very flexible. You choose the time slot—mornings, evenings, or weekends—and we match you with an instructor. There are no fixed batch dates, so FocusONE works for working professionals, cadet pilots, and anyone with a busy schedule. Book one session at a time or block multiple sessions in advance; you can space them according to your study plan and exam date. SkyPrep Aero's team helps you find slots that suit your time zone and commitments across India.",
